# Sketch-to-Icon Paper Code
This repo contains the full code of my Sketch-to-Icon thesis project.

The main topic is SBIR (Sketch based image retrieval) and Neural Networks. The two main goals of the project are: 
- find an effective CBIR method;
- fill the draw-icon gap.

3 methods are assessed:
- draws and edge-extracted icons (Classification Neural Network and Autoencoder);
- half-shared weights (Triplet network);
- mixed dataset (Classification Neural Network)

3 network architectures are assessed:
- "simple" CNN;
- Mobilenet v1;
- Resnet-50.


## Development
The project is developed thanks to Google's Colab platform.
